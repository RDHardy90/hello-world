**Hi everyone, my name is Robert Hardy**
Here are a few facts about myself: 1. I'm from Indianapolis, Indiana. 2. I am 33 this year. 3. I'm a student at Ivy Tech Community College 4. Despite the fact that I fit the stereotype of what I think most people imagine when they picture a computer guy, I am not one. In fact, 5. I have no coding experience.
